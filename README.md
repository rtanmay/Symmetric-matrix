# Symmetric-matrix
This repository contains a c++ program that inputs a N x N symmetric matrix and stores only the upper or lower triangular elements to optimize the computer storage.

The following operations are done on the matrix to check the reliabilty of the program.

  ``1)changing elements of only one triangle(upper or lower)

  2)addition/subtraction(inputting two matrices in which atleast one is symmetric)
  
  3)multiplication of two matrices.``
  
**The program also outputs the space saved(as compared to when the whole matrix is stored instead of just upper or lower triangular elements)**

The value of N can range till (long long), so the total elements the matrix can contain are: 

It is evident that storage optimization becomes more important when we have very large number of data elements.
